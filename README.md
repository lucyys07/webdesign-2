Description of Project: Events in Alabama is your go-to source for discovering whatâ€™s happening across the state. From music festivals and food fairs to community gatherings and cultural events, this website showcases a curated selection of upcoming happenings in Alabama. Our goal is to encourage community engagement by making it easy for residents and visitors to stay informed, participate, and connect with local events that match their interests.

Explain how you accomplished this Project: To create this guide, I started by collecting all the important details that families look at when choosing a college. Then, using the design tool Figma, I made a website layout that's easy to use and looks good. After that, I built the actual website with tools like HTML and CSS, adding a feature that lets users compare different colleges. I also set up a system to keep the college information on the website up to date. This website is meant to be a helpful starting point for students and parents to find the right college in Alabama.
